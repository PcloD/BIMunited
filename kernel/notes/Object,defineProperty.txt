Yes, there is. At least for object properties, ES5 gave us the possiblity to alter the property descriptor flags by hand. So we can do that like

var data = { };

Object.defineProperty(data, 'secret', {
    value: 42,
    writable : false,
    enumerable : true,
    configurable : false
});

That way, we created a property secret with the value 42 within data, which cannot get modfied nor deleted.
